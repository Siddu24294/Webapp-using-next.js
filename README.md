This is a web app that will help u on your travell by keeping a ract of your flight bookings , accommodation and tourage.
This was my 1st time building a web app.
Having only developed in python it wwas quite challenging at the beggining.
It took me 8 hrs to build this even after following the tutorial and i don;t know wher but i ruined my first repository.
So i had to start from the beginning.
By the end I developed a learning in the syntax and started to understand how the framewok works.
This taught me a lot and was quite an enjoyable expeience.
